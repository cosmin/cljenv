CLJENV

Installation:
  Currently only BASH 3 or later or ZSH are supported.
  Source activate.sh to get cljenv shell functionality.

  This will call cljenv autostart NOPS1 to initialize the default clojure
  environment.

Starting Clojure:
  clj # starts a new clojure repl
  clj swank # starts a clojure swank server, so you can attach 
  clj path/to/file.clj # starts a new repl after running the following file

Emacs Support:
  ELPA is a much better way to deal with what you need for Clojure in Emacs.
  Install ELPA and from it you can install clojure-mode and slime. Then start
  a swank server from the command line by running 'clj swank' and then
  use M-x slime-connect from Emacs to connect to it.

Default environments:

  USER: $HOME/.cljenv
  SYSTEM: /etc/cljenv/system_cljenv
  DEFAULT: /path/to/installation/folder/default_cljenv

Activating an environment:

  cljenv autostart # activate the first environment of USER, SYSTEM, DEFAULT
  cljenv autostart NOPS1 # activate the first env, but surpress PS1 modification

  cljenv user # activate the user environment
  cljenv system # activate the system environment
  cljenv default # activate the default environment

  # use the following commmands to activate environments you create (see below)

  cljenv activate # activate the environment in the current directory
  cljenv activate path/to/env/folder # activate the given environment

Creating a new environment:

  cljenv create # create a new environment in the current folder
  cljenv create path_to_folder # create a new environment in the given folder

  After running cljenv_create edit the .cljenv file in either the current or
  specified folders to set your options for java, clojure, and clojure-contrib

Deactivating an environment:

  cljenv deactivate # deactivate the currently active environment
