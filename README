CLJENV

Installation:
  Currently only BASH 3 or later or ZSH are supported.
  
  Run install.sh to initialize submodules the very first time.
  Then source setup.sh to get cljenv shell functionality.

Emacs Support:
  Place the following in your .emacs to get support for cljenv inside of Emacs.

  (load (concat (getenv "CLJENV_HOME") "/" "setup.el"))

  This will configure Clojure, Slime and swank-clojure to use the same
  environment that you have activated before starting emacs. Note that at the
  moment you will need to start Emacs from within a shell where cljenv is
  activated.

Default environments:

  USER: $HOME/.cljenv
  SYSTEM: /etc/cljenv/system_cljenv
  DEFAULT: /path/to/installation/folder/default_cljenv

Activating an environment:

  cljenv_autostart # activate the first environment of USER, SYSTEM, DEFAULT
  cljenv_autostart NOPS1 # activate the first env, but surpress PS1 modification

  cljenv_user # activate the user environment
  cljenv_system # activate the system environment
  cljenv_default # activate the default environment

  # use the following commmands to activate environments you create (see below)

  cljenv_activate # activate the environment in the current directory
  cljenv_activate path/to/env/folder # activate the given environment

Creating a new environment:

  cljenv_create # create a new environment in the current folder
  cljenv_create path_to_folder # create a new environment in the given folder

  After running cljenv_create edit the .cljenv file in either the current or
  specified folders to set your options for java, clojure, and clojure-contrib

Deactivating an environment:

  cljenv_deactivate # deactivate the currently active environment
